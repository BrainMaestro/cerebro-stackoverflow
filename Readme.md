> Cerebro plugin to find answers to questions on stack overflow

![](usage.gif)

## Usage
In Cerebro, type a search query. The first few questions will show in the detail pane. Clicking on any of them will show the question body and any of the answers it has.


## Features

* Search for questions on stack overflow with google or with the stack exchange search api.
* Show preview with more details: poster, body, answers.

### Common Issues
Google and Stackoverflow implement some form of rate limiting, so constant searches over a short period of time will eventually lead to errors.

### Todo
- [ ] Add loading indicator.
- [ ] Indicate selected answer.
- [ ] Show the user that posted each answer. 
- [ ] Make a proper usage gif or screenshot.
